## Problem Definition 
 
Quora is a platform for Question and Answer. One of the many problems that Quora face is the duplication of questions. Duplication of question ruins the experience for both the questioner and the answerer. Since the questioner is asking a duplicate question, we can just show him/her the answers to the previous question. And the answerer doesn’t have to repeat his/her answer for essentially the same questions. 
For example, we have a question like “Who is the Prime Minister Of India?” and there are some answers to that question. Later someone else asks another question like “Who is the Current Prime Minister Of India?”. We can see that both the questions are asking the same thing. Even though the word "Current “for the question are different, the intention of both questions is the same. So the answers will be the same for both questions. That means we can just show the answers to the first question. That way the person who is asking the question will get the answers immediately and people who have answered already the first question don’t have to repeat themselves.
